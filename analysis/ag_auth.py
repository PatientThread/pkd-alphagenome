"""
ag_auth.py  -  single place the AlphaGenome API key is loaded from.

THE KEY IS NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY AND MUST NEVER BE.

This project tree is covered by daily OneDrive snapshots and a private git
repository. Anything written here leaves the machine. A previous incident in this
portfolio began with credentials sitting in an RTF file and ended in rotating
AWS, Anthropic and JWT secrets, so this is a repeat risk, not a hypothetical one.

The key therefore lives at ~/.alphagenome/api_key, mode 600, outside every synced
directory. That matches the convention already used for the trading keys in
~/.t212.

Resolution order:
    1. environment variable ALPHAGENOME_API_KEY
    2. ~/.alphagenome/api_key

Usage:
    from ag_auth import get_key, make_client
    client = make_client()
